 * Explanation:
 * In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model.
 * Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of
 * the class of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
